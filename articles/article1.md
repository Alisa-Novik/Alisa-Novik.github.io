# 🧠 3 Hacks If You're Starting Your EB-1A Case

I’ve spent over **$20,000** and **five intense months** working on my EB-1A green card application.  
This post is a **distilled summary** of everything I’ve learned through producing hundreds of supporting documents, interacting with dozens of people, and navigating the U.S. immigration system.

My colleague at Oracle, **Mebin**, once said:  
> *"Immigration is unpaid work."*  
He was only half right.

The other half is this: **it's work you pay for — and pay a lot.**  
But like every major investment, timing and strategy can make all the difference.

If you're just beginning your EB-1A journey, these three hacks can save you **a massive amount of time, mental energy, and unnecessary stress**.

## 🧾 1. Maintain a Running List of Everyone Involved in Your Case

If you don’t already have a list of people involved in your EB-1A process, **start one today**.

Personally, I have **over 30 individuals** connected to my case in some way — and no, that's not an exaggeration.

Here’s a sample of roles that might show up on your list:
- Your **immigration attorney** or legal team
- **Media contributors** who helped with press coverage
- **Journal editors** you’ve worked with for publications or peer reviews
- **Professional association contacts**
- **Translators**, if your documents include non-English material
- **Recommenders**, mentors, or colleagues providing support letters

I use **Telegram**, which conveniently lets me group chats (private or group) into folders — a feature widely used in Eastern Europe.  
But you can also manage this in **Google Sheets**, **Notion**, or even a physical notebook if that's your style.

💡 *This single trick saved me hours of hunting down names, emails, and message history. It also kept me calm during chaotic review phases.*

## 📊 2. Define Your Criteria Prioritization Order

All EB-1A criteria are technically equal in the eyes of USCIS. There’s no hidden rubric or weighted scoring system… but **not all criteria are created equal in practice.**

If you're aiming for a **strong narrative**, define your **personal prioritization order** early.

Here’s the order that worked best for me:

**1. Original Contributions of Major Significance**  
**2. Critical/Key Role in a Distinguished Organization**  
**3. Everything Else** (e.g., judging, associations, media)

Why this order?

Because:
- It’s easier to build **momentum** when you’re starting with your strongest, most substantive evidence.
- These two criteria tend to form the **core of your petition story** — they show *impact* and *credibility*.
- The rest (like judging or memberships) becomes much easier to fit around that central narrative.

If you start with weak, checklist-driven criteria, you risk building a case that lacks cohesion and strength.

## 🗂️ 3. Don’t Wait to Create a Document Archive

This wasn’t in the original list — but if you’re serious about saving time:

> **Start organizing all your documents in a proper folder structure immediately.**

Use:
- A consistent naming convention (e.g. `01-key-role/`, `02-innovation/`, `03-publications/`)
- Version control (especially for letters, translations, and forms)
- A shared folder with your lawyer (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)

You’ll thank yourself later when USCIS asks for an RFE (Request for Evidence) and you can respond in a single afternoon.

## Final Thought

The EB-1A process is **a project**.  
If you treat it like one — with documentation, strategy, and clear goals — it becomes less painful and more empowering.

And hey, you’re not just applying for a visa.

You’re **writing the story of your career** — and showing why the world needs you.

Good luck. You've got this.
