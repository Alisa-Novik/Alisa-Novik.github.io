# Maintain a running list of people related to your EB-1A case
If you don't have such list, you should create one today. I have more than 30 people involved in my EB-1A case in one way or another.

I use Telegram which provides feature to group related private or group chats and is widely used in Eastern Europe, so I had this out of the box. You can use something as simple as Google Sheets.
The most obvious and big one is an attorney team. This may not be the case for you depending of your attorney choice. The you optionally have media coverage folks, journal contacts, translators, professional association community managers if you're applying into one. 
This trick alone saved me hours of searching and I'm glad I did that one early.
